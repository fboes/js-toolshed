Documentation
-------------

See the [inline documentation](src/js-toolshed.js) for new methods to use.

* `Math`- & `Number`-methods for rounding and styled output of numbers
* `Array`-methods for smart adding of new values and fast manipulation of values
* `String`-methods
* An improved `Date`-object acting as a parser for ISO-formatted dates
* `Elemente`-methods for class- and event-manipulation
* A stub `console` to remove warnings in old browsers for missing console

There is also [a small polyfill](src/js-legacy.js) to give older browsers some new Javascript methods.
