[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/fboes/js-toolshed/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/fboes/js-toolshed#info=devDependencies)

Javascript Toolshed adds some basic methods to already existing JS prototypes / objects.

And remember: [You might not need jQuery](docs/no-jquery.md) and use [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) instead.

Installation

Documentation

See the [auto documentation](docs/api.md) for new methods to use.

* `Math` & `Number` get new methods for rounding and styled output of numbers.
* `Array` gets new methods for smart adding of new values and fast manipulation of values.
* `String` gets lots of new methods for outputting various stuff.
* An improved `Date`-object acts as a parser for ISO-formatted dates.
